# PROGRAMMER ... Options to avrdude which define the hardware you use for
#                uploading to the AVR and the interface where this hardware
#                is connected.
# PROGRAMMER_PORT ...  the port the programmer is attached to. This is highly 
#                dependent on your programmer and operating system.

# This are the hardware settings for the Blinken Buttons for Beginners. There is
# normally no need tho change these (or anything below) (if you do not change 
# the hardware of the Blinken Buttons for Beginners, what is quite improbable).
# DEVICE ....... The AVR device you compile for
# CLOCK ........ Target AVR clock rate in Hertz
# OBJECTS ...... The object files created from your source files. This list is
#                usually the same as the list of source files with suffix ".o".
# FUSES ........ Parameters for avrdude to flash the fuses appropriately.
